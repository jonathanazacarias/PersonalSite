I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades, with a particular interest in anything “tech”. I am a problem solver, a“tinkerer”, and a people person; which is why I love to code, tear apart engines, and play the game of Risk. I have had a wide array of jobs over the years, but my degree is in Computer Science, and I would love to put my software development skills to work! Lately I have been putting that together with some of my IT knowledge to bring you this react site. It is being hosted on my very own home server, if you want to learn more about how to do that or get a game server running (for dummies, learned from doing it myself) go check out that project here!",
