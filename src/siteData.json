      "personalStatement": "I am a lifelong learner, drawn to the pursuit of many crafts. A *renaissance approach* to life and work—one that embraces diversity and cultivates a holistic understanding of the world—does more than make life more fulfilling and interesting; it fosters resourcefulness and transforms obstacles into opportunities. Mastery in any domain is strengthened by knowledge across others. To embrace diversity is to acknowledge the limits of one’s own knowledge, to relinquish ego, and, often, to rise above the instinctive biases of the human psyche in favor of objective results. \n\nTo be results-oriented is not to be rigid or inflexible, but rather to be unwavering in purpose. Adapting methodology as necessary to achieve the goal. The “results” one pursues must be chosen with care, they should be a reflection of purpose. My chosen purpose—the ultimate metric by which I hold myself accountable—is the magnification of joy and the alleviation of suffering within my sphere of influence. \n\nThis is why I am drawn to technology. When wielded with integrity—_people before profit_—it is among the most powerful tools humanity possesses to uplift and to serve. \n\nI have an obsessive fascination with **foundational integrity.** There are times when pragmatism demands expediency, but whenever possible, I am compelled to dig deeper. A superficial fix will not restore a decaying foundation; a hasty solution will not withstand the test of time. The quick patch, the sloppy line of code, the stripped bolt, dismissed as trivial—will reemerge, often at the worst possible moment. I have learned this lesson through experience and will continue to learn it. \n\nTo create and adhere to a standard is not enough—I must *understand* it. The depth of that understanding determines my ability to adapt when systems fail, to pivot without compromising quality. This is why I seek to uncover the full context of any problem or craft I engage in. This knowledge provides a framework, a foundation from which to operate. It helps to temper and balance the spark of creativity and passion with the structure of discipline, allowing for both innovation and enduring solutions. \n\nMy obsession with integrity extends to an obsession with quality. The processes, products, tools, I create, consume, and use must be built with intention, scoped perfectly for their task—engineered for longevity, designed with simplicity and the human in mind, yet built on a foundation that is capable of more than you expect. They should be recyclable, reusable, and wherever possible imbued with redundancy, ensuring resilience. \n\nCommunication is the cornerstone of both personal and professional success. Precision in language is as vital as precision in action; words, too, must reflect purpose. \n\nHow do I respond when confronted with my own failure—when I am forced to acknowledge that I have fallen short? Do I retreat into defensiveness, or do I interrogate the critique, searching for the truth within it? The impulse to resist is often a reflection of an unspoken recognition, a quiet admission that the criticism aligns with my own unvoiced doubts. Step beyond the instinct to shield ego, and instead, let scrutiny become a tool for improvement. Failure is an inevitability, and it is natural to feel disappointment when it occurs. However, lingering in failure—allowing it to erode standards or diminish my sense of agency—is unacceptable. I must analyze failure only as long as is necessary to extract its lessons, then move forward. Self-efficacy must be preserved. I firmly hold the belief that, within reason, there is almost nothing I cannot create, repair, or learn. More often than not, I will choose to acquire the tools, gather the materials, and develop the skill rather than lose the chance to expand the domains of my knowledge and ability. \n\nI do not always meet the standards I set for myself—indeed, I fail to achieve them more often than I succeed. Yet, I believe in grace. The pursuit of the highest degree of excellence demands both ambition and forgiveness. If I choose to set the bar unreasonably high, I must also embrace the inevitability of falling short. \n\n**Excellence is not perfection. It is an unwillingness to settle.** It is the continual pursuit of refinement, the relentless drive to improve, and the steadfast commitment to the purpose behind my work.",

        "projectMarkdown": "![img](images/projects/HTMLPortfolioSite/htmlSiteImage.png)\n## About the Project\nThe website you are on now began it's life as a simple HTML and CSS site. I first created the site in HTML a couple of years ago and it served as the framework from which to build this site in React. A early, incomplete GitHub repo of this site can be found [here.](https://github.com/jonathanazacarias/Personal-portfolio-site) \n\n## Items of Note\n1. One of the most interesting things I learned to do through this site was with the door panels on the home page of the site (pictured above). I tried to come up with the most simple way to transition the image from a closed to a open door on ``` hover ```. To acomplish this I created two svg images of exactly the same size, one with a closed door image, and one with a open door image. These images were both put in as direct decendents of an ``` <a> ``` tag, one with a class of \"door\" and the other as \"hover-door\" (it turns out this second class is not even necessary). Then in the CSS, the \"door\" class recived a ``` height ```, and  ``` position: absolute ```. The positioning of the first item is important as it allows for the first item to be positioned on top of the second, as oposed to the default block positioning where they would be positioned next to eachouther within the parent tag. Since both images are exactly the same size, the second image is fully obscured by the first. Next, the ``` opacity ``` in the ``` .door:hover ``` class is set to 0. So when a user hovers over the image, the opacity of the first image in the ``` <a> ``` tag is set to 0 reveling the second image that is hidden beneth it. Since it does not use any javascript, and it does not use the ``` content ``` attribute in CSS, this method allows for a very quick and smooth transition between the two images, while maintaining a seperation of concerns. I later found almost this exact process being described [here](https://sirv.com/help/articles/hover-change-image/), but with a different order of items being obscured or shown.\n\n\n## Future of the Project\nThis HTML site is now depricated as I have built it bigger and better with React. It is however a lightweight backup to the react site should I ever need to fallback to a simpler version of the site. I may therefore continue to update this HTML version of the project. "

A GitHub repo for the project can be found [here.](https://github.com/jonathanazacarias/Blog-Site-Project)\n\n\n## Items of Note\n1. Dynamic Rendering: The server uses EJS templates to render pages like the homepage (index.ejs), the post creation page (new-post.ejs), and individual post pages (post.ejs).\n2. Post Management: New posts are submitted via a POST request to /submit, where the title, content, and an optional image URL are captured. The post is assigned a unique ID and stored in the postCards array.\n3. Viewing Posts: The postId from the user input is used to retrieve the correct post from the array, which is then displayed on a separate page.\n\n\n## Future of the Project\nThe main purpose of this project was to practice using express and EJS. It does demonstrate key web development concepts such as handling form submissions, managing dynamic data, and generating unique identifiers that could be great to expose and demonstrate in an interactive way. I may take time to expand upon the basic feature-set to make it a fully RESTful API, then expose some of the code to create an interactive experience to demonstrate RESTful concepts."

        "thumbnailImg": "toDoTeams/toDoTeams.png",
        "projectDate": "",
        "lastUpdated": "",
        "projectMarkdown": "![img](images/projects/toDoTeams/toDoTeams.png)\n## About the Project\nThis project is a full-stack application featuring a React frontend and an Express backend, with PostgreSQL used for persistent data storage. The app is an expansion of the classic to-do list project, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete lists, as well as collaborate with friends on lists. It has very minimal styling as the main purpose of the app was to practice the creation of a full stack app, but the app was designed such that it will be straight forward to add styling.  \n\n## Frontend (React):\nThe GitHub repo for the react front end can be found [here.](https://github.com/jonathanazacarias/To-Do-Teams) \n 1. Routing & Navigation:\n\n    - The frontend uses React Router for managing navigation between different routes.\n     - The use of ProtectedRoute ensures that users must be authenticated to access pages like \"Lists\" and \"Friends\". If not logged in, they are redirected to the login page.\n 2. State Management & User Authentication:\n\n    - The app leverages React Context to manage authentication state (useAuth hook) and provides login functionality via a form.\n     - Users can log in with their credentials (email and password) or via  OAuth (Google/Facebook).\n     - Upon successful login, users are redirected to their \"Lists\" page. 3. UI/UX:\n    - The app allows users to manage to-do lists, view their friends, and interact with them via friend requests. This includes creating new lists, viewing list items, and editing or deleting them.\n     - The user experience is enhanced by features like handling form submissions with clear error messages.\n ## Backend (Express.js):\nThe GitHub repo for the express back end can be found [here.](https://github.com/jonathanazacarias/To-Do-Teams-Server)\n1. Authentication & Authorization:\n    - The backend uses Passport.js to handle user authentication. It supports local authentication (username and password) and OAuth authentication.\n     - Sessions are managed using express-session, with cookies that last for one day, and CORS is configured to allow communication between the React frontend and the Express backend. \n\n2. Database (PostgreSQL):\n    - PostgreSQL is used for persistent data storage, with tables for users, lists, list_items, and friends.\n     - The app’s backend handles creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. \n\n3. Interesting Features:\n    - Dynamic Data Management: Data for lists and friends is dynamically loaded based on the authenticated user. This ensures that each user only interacts with their own data.\n     - Password Security: Bcrypt is used to hash and salt user passwords before storing them in the database, ensuring secure handling of user credentials.\n     - Friendship System: The app includes a friend request system, with the ability to search for friends, send requests, and approve or reject them. This adds a social dimension to the app beyond just managing to-do lists. \n\n## Items of Note:\n1. Full-Stack Architecture:\n    - The combination of React for the frontend, Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database makes this a robust full-stack application. The frontend and backend are tightly integrated with session management, allowing for seamless interaction between the client and server. \n\n2. Session-Based Authentication:\n    - The app uses sessions to manage user login state. This allows users to stay logged in between page reloads and ensures that sensitive operations (like managing lists and friends) are restricted to authenticated users only. \n\n3. Friend System & Social Interactions:\n    - The inclusion of a friendship system is a unique aspect. It allows users to search for friends, send friend requests, and approve or reject them. This adds a social networking feature to the typical to-do list app. \n\n4. Dynamic and Scalable Database Operations:\n    - The backend is designed to handle multiple users and their associated data (lists, items, and friends). The use of SQL queries ensures that users can easily fetch and manipulate their data, making it easy to scale the app in the future. \n\n## Main Concepts Practiced\n1. Frontend: React (with routing, state management, and authentication), form handling, lifecycle hooks.\n2. Backend: Express.js, Passport.js, session management, error handling, RESTful APIs.\n3. Database: PostgreSQL, SQL querying, parameterized queries, database relationships.\n4. Security: Password hashing (bcrypt), session-based authentication, CORS configuration, data validation.\n5. General Skills: Modular code, async/await, environment variables, external libraries like Axios.\n\n\n## Future of the Project\nThis is a great project to expand upon! In it's current state it has the basis of a great well rounded app. I may expand upon it further in the future to add styling and make it look good, and use the express backend in a react native app project to practice some app development."

        "projectMarkdown": "![img](images/projects/homeNetwork/network.png)\n## About the Project\n\n\nBefore starting this project, I had never heard of a subnet, had only a basic understanding of IP addresses, and knew I could have a guest network. However, I recognized that if I wanted to set up a Minecraft server or host a website, I would need to learn about these networking concepts. Throughout this project, I explored the protocols and technologies that power the internet, gained hands-on experience with the hardware and software used to build networks, and learned how to set up and troubleshoot my own home network.\n\n\n## Helpful Resources\n\n\nAs I began researching how to build a home network capable of handling my needs, I found several valuable resources that helped me go from a minimal understanding of networking to preparing for the CompTIA Network+ certification. \n\n- For an introduction to networking and its applications, the [Crosstalk Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/@CrosstalkSolutions) and [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) YouTube channels provide a wealth of beginner-friendly content.\n- For more in-depth training, [Dion Training](https://www.diontraining.com/courses) offers courses designed to help individuals become certified in networking and cybersecurity.\n- Understanding the basics of Linux is essential for many networking tasks. The [Learn Linux TV](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnLinuxTV) YouTube channel is an excellent resource for networking with Linux and general Linux education.\n\n\n## The Project\n\n\nBefore diving in, I outlined my network goals and identified the key tasks I needed to accomplish: \n\n### Objectives:\n- Host my own website(s)\n- Run game servers\n- Set up an AI server\n- Implement network-attached storage and backups\n- Enable secure remote access to my home network\n- Ensure security best practices and industry standards are followed\n\n\nFrom watching Crosstalk Solutions and NetworkChuck, I realized that the all-in-one modem/router/access point provided by Xfinity wouldn't be sufficient. I needed dedicated hardware and software to build a robust network. Based on recommendations from Crosstalk Solutions, I opted for a Ubiquiti setup to simplify configuration and maintenance. I purchased second-hand equipment on eBay, including:\n\n\n- Xfinity modem (used in bridge mode)\n- Edgerouter X (ER-X) router\n- Unifi Flex Mini switches\n- Unifi AC-HD access point\n\n\nHowever, I quickly discovered an issue—while most of my equipment was compatible with the Ubiquiti Unifi Controller, the Edgerouter X was not. Since I had purchased it from a private seller on eBay, returning it wasn't an option. Rather than replacing it, I decided to proceed with the Edgerouter X and learn how to configure it manually. \n\nInitially, this presented a steep learning curve. I needed VLANs to segment my network, keeping exposed services isolated from internal traffic. Unifi makes VLAN configuration easy through its GUI, but I struggled to set them up on the Edgerouter X. In my early attempts, I experimented with the router’s settings, which led to multiple lockouts from the interface. Eventually, I bricked the router, or so I thought. Fortunately, I found a solution: using a USB-serial connection and a TFTP server to recover the firmware. (For those facing a similar issue, here’s a helpful [video on recovering a bricked Edgerouter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRui3Qg5nS0&t=67s).)\n\n\nAfter recovering the router, I realized it was time to properly study networking fundamentals. I enrolled in a CompTIA Network+ course to learn about DHCP, DNS, VLANs, and firewall rules. After completing the course in a few weeks, I successfully configured the Edgerouter X and moved on to setting up the Unifi devices. The Unifi ecosystem lived up to its reputation—I had the Unifi portion of my network running within a day! \n\nWith the hardware set up, the next step was configuring VLANs, DHCP servers, and DNS settings. I divided my network into: - **Main Network:** For general home use\n- **Guest Network:** Isolated for visitors\n- **Public Network:** Hosting public-facing services (e.g., game servers, web servers)\n- **IoT Network:** For smart devices\n- **Management Network:** For network administration and private services\n\n\nSegmenting the network this way is crucial for securely hosting public services. Along with enabling modern security protocols, locking down access to network interfaces, and implementing proper firewall rules, these steps help safeguard the home network. \n\n## The Future of the Project\n\n\nMy network will evolve as my needs change, and maintaining its security will be an ongoing task. One of my next goals is to implement a local AI server, which remains an active project. This journey has been an invaluable learning experience, and I look forward to continuing to expand and refine my network setup."

Here is how that went. \n\n## The Project\nOne rainy Washington day, being the nerd on a budget that I am, I was scrolling through Facebook Marketplace for computers and computer parts when I came across a listing for a old Dell Poweredge server computer. A datacenter in Bellevue was cleaning out and selling old inventory to make room for new servers, so I headed over after work and picked it up for $100. I had a few 2Tb HDDs sitting around to throw into it and picked up a bunch of server ram from ebay for another $30. With everything gathered up I pulled it open, stuffed all of the goodies in, and sealed it back in to load up an operating system. I grabbed my ProxMox USB, plugged everything up and hit power on. This is where the learning began. \n\nHaving been pulled from a working environment, and the datacenter have just pulled the hard drives out, the server lit up with all the new hardware I had out in, and was not happy about its old hard drives having been pulled out. Not being sure what to expect when looking for bios on a server computer I did not really understand what iDrac was or how to use it, how to set up RAID for my new drives, or what the lifecycle controller was. After spending an hour clicking around the various menues I attemped to update the machine with the Dell Package Manager. Unfortunatly this particular Dell software seems to be quite buggy and did not seem to be pulling up update packages for a old R420. I switched over to giving the ProxMox install a go, but not having set up the RAID controller for the new drives, I could not move forward with the ProxMox install. I gave up for the night and ordered a ssd to use as the boot drive. A few days later I was able to return to the set up and install the ssd in place of the disk drive. I then also learned I needed to set up RAID for the new disks and went ahead with that. Now I was finally able to get ProxMox installed! \n\n![img](images/projects/homeServer/proxmox.png)\n\n\nWith the machine all set up it was time to get going with a couple VMs! I went ahead and loaded up a plethora of Ubuntu desktop and server VMs to see what we could do! If you want to see how I got a couple of game servers going in ProxMox with LGSM check out that project on my projects page! \n\n## Future of the Project\nThis was a big addition to the overall project of building out my home lab. I am also going to be adding a few more nodes to my home lab and swapping everything over to ProxMox after really enjoying working with it on this set-up. This machine itself is fairly filled out in terms of hardware, so it will most likely remain in service until it can continue no longer!"

        "projectMarkdown": "![img](images/projects/operationGrandmaster/grandmaster.jpeg)\nI like playing board games, and ever since taking a college course in game theory, I have been obsessed with the strategies behind them and the mathematical principles that govern optimal play. *Operation Grandmaster* is the practical manifestation of this obsession—my lifelong endeavor to become the person at any gathering whom no one dares to challenge, for fear of full and complete annihilation. \n\nMy primary focus is on games that use a ranked system from novice to grandmaster, but I do not limit myself to these. I have already achieved the highest levels of mastery in *Risk: Global Domination, Settlers of Catan, Checkers,* and *Monopoly* (yes, there is some skill in Monopoly). I continue to push for mastery in *Chess, Go, Ticket to Ride, Othello, Mancala, Stratego,* and several others. \n\nI analyze games through multiple lenses—achievement criteria, mechanics, and strategy types. The first and most natural way I categorize a game is by placing it along the spectrum of *skill-based* versus *luck-based* play. This distinction informs the types of strategies required for mastery. However, even games that lean heavily toward chance can be mastered—just not in the way people traditionally expect.\n\n\nTake *Risk*, for example. It is often thought that if you find yourself in a stagnant three-player standoff, the game ultimately hinges on luck—who your opponents choose to attack. While chance plays a role, there is a deeper strategic layer: understanding human psychology, the principles of reciprocity and loss aversion, and the statistical probabilities of engagements. By mastering these, you can consistently maneuver yourself into a \"less likely to be attacked\" position, mitigating randomness and turning it into an advantage.\n\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of this pursuit is how often my initial assumptions about a game's mechanics and optimal strategies are proven wrong. More often than not, every game has hidden patterns, strategic exploits, and nuances that, when understood, can tilt the odds in one’s favor. \n\nMy approach to mastery follows a structured methodology. First, I immerse myself in playing the game to develop an intuitive understanding of its mechanics. From there, I break down its core skill requirements—whether they involve probability calculations, resource management, psychological manipulation, or pattern recognition. I then refine my strategies by studying high-level play, analyzing decision trees, and testing my theories in real competitive settings.\n\n\nBeyond the games themselves, I’ve found that the pursuit of mastery teaches invaluable lessons applicable outside the game board—lessons in patience, risk assessment, negotiation, and even human behavior. Many of these insights translate into real-world decision-making, reinforcing the idea that games are more than just entertainment; they are microcosms of strategy, psychology, and life itself.\n\n\nOperation Grandmaster is not just about winning—it’s about dissecting, understanding, and ultimately mastering the fundamental principles that govern competition. And perhaps, one day, I will achieve the ultimate goal: to sit at the table and know, with absolute certainty, that victory is inevitable."
