This React site is my own personal portfolio site. It is still under development and has a few quirks and unfinished bits as of 3/10/25.

## Clone
To get started with this site, clone the repository, run ```npm i``` and ```npm run dev``` to start a develpoment server with the site.

## Git
Seeing as how this product is now in production, I am in the process of standardizing my git branches to better and more safely maintain/ update this code base. All development will be done on, and development branches will be created from, the main development branch. The development branch will then be realeased to the main branch when features are ready. The main branch will only be for production ready code. I do not have test servers at this time, but I may implement some in the future.
